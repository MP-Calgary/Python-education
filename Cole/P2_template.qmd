## QUESTION|TASK 2

__This three-part question requires you to calculate batting average (number of hits divided by the number of at-bats)__  
    a. Write an SQL query that provides playerID, yearID, and batting average for players with at least 1 at bat that year. Sort the table from highest batting average to lowest, and then by playerid alphabetically. Show the top 5 results in your report.  
    a. Use the same query as above, but only include players with at least 10 at bats that year. Print the top 5 results.  
    a. Now calculate the batting average for players over their entire careers (all years combined). Only include players with at least 100 at bats, and print the top 5 results.

## STRETCH QUESTION|TASK 1

__Advanced Salary Distribution by Position (with Case Statement):__  

    * Write an SQL query that provides a summary table showing the average salary for players in each position (e.g., pitcher, catcher, outfielder) across all years. Include the following columns:

        * position
        * average_salary
        * total_players
        * highest_salary  

    * The highest_salary column should display the highest salary ever earned by a player in that position. If no player in that position has a recorded salary, display “N/A” for the highest salary.  

    * Additionally, create a new column called salary_category using a case statement:  

        * If the average salary is above $1 million, categorize it as “High Salary.”  
        * If the average salary is between $500,000 and $1 million, categorize it as “Medium Salary.”  
        * Otherwise, categorize it as “Low Salary.”  

    * Order the table by average salary in descending order.
    * Print the top 10 rows of this summary table.

        * playerID
        * first_name
        * last_name
        * career_length
