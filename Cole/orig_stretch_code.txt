The following core works as expected, but I have to make a few adjustments
The Y-Axis label should be 'Total, it is now 'Number of Occurences'
The top label should be 'Elliot... What?', it is now 'Usage of the name 'Elliot' over the years (1950-2020)'
The Y-Axis currently goes from 0 to 1,300.  I want it to go from 0 to 1200, in 200 increments, with no comma in the years

Can you make those changes
