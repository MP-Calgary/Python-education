Function francois_algorithm(n)
   If n is equal to 1, return [2]
   Otherwise, if n is equal to 2, return [2, 1]

   Initialize the sequence as [2, 1]
   
   Loop from 3 to n+1:
      Compute the next term as the sum of the last two terms in the sequence.
      Append the next term to the sequence.
   
   Return the sequence.
   
   

Set n as number of sequences want to calculate up to the nth term

call francois_algorithm(n)

Print the sequence
