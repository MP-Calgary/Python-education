I have the following python code, running in a quarto notebook.
I have a SQLite database ahmansbaseballdb.sqlite, which contains statistics for baseball.
What I am trying to do, is understand the impact of homeruns (Column HR) vs wins (column W) over the years of time (column yearID).
Below generates a nice scatter graph, but I can't really see the impact of year on the data, rght now I see HR vs wins.
what can I do to highlight the time factor more (column yearID)?

# this file must be in the same location as your .qmd or .py file
con = sqlite3.connect(sqlite_file)

# Load the query result into a DataFrame
df = pd.read_sql_query(query, con)

# Filter data for years >= 1995
df_filtered = df[df['yearID'] >= 1995]

df_filtered = df_filtered.dropna(subset=['W', 'HR'])

# Create the scatter plot
