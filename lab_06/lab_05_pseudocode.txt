Ask the user to enter the file path for a word list in JSON format and store it in "file_path"

Check if the file at "file_path" exists

If the file exists:
    Open the file and load its contents into a dictionary called "word_list"
    Close the file
    
    Extract the list of words from "word_list" and store it in "array_values"

    Ask the user to enter a word to search for and store it in "search_word"

    Set the minimum index "min_index" to 0
    Set the maximum index "max_index" to the length of "array_values" minus 1

    Set a flag "found" to False

    While "min_index" is less than or equal to "max_index" and "found" is False:
        Calculate the middle index "mid_index" as the integer division of ("min_index" + "max_index") by 2

        If the word at "array_values[mid_index]" is equal to "search_word":
            Print "The word is found at index" followed by "mid_index"
            Set "found" to True
        Else if the word at "array_values[mid_index]" is less than "search_word":
            Set "min_index" to "mid_index" + 1
        Else:
            Set "max_index" to "mid_index" - 1

    If "found" is still False:
        Print "The word is not found in the list"
Else:
    Print "The file" followed by "file_path" followed by "does not exist."
