I have a SQLite database of baseball statistcs called 'lahmansbaseballdb.sqlite'.

I want to do the following:
Write an SQL query that provides a summary table showing the average salary for players in each position (e.g., pitcher, catcher, outfielder) across all years. Include the following columns:

position
average_salary
total_players
highest_salary
The highest_salary column should display the highest salary ever earned by a player in that position. If no player in that position has a recorded salary, display “N/A” for the highest salary.

Additionally, create a new column called salary_category using a case statement:

If the average salary is above $1 million, categorize it as “High Salary.”
If the average salary is between $500,000 and $1 million, categorize it as “Medium Salary.”
Otherwise, categorize it as “Low Salary.”
Order the table by average salary in descending order.

The definition of tables is below:

Table 'Fielding' has columns 'playerID' and 'POS' where pos stands for Position

The unique values of POS are P, OF, 2B, 3B, 1B, SS, C
This is what coresponds to pitcher, catcher, outfielder, but leaving as the code is fine.

Table Salaries has columns 'playerID' and their salary in column 'salary'
